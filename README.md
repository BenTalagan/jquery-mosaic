# jquery-mosaic
See it working and examples running here: http://jquery-mosaic.tin.cat

A jQuery plugin by Tin.cat to build beautifully arranged and responsive mosaics of html elements maintaining their original aspect ratio. Works wonderfully with images by creating a visually ordered and pleasant mosaic (much like mosaics on Flickr, 500px and Google+) without gaps between elements, but at the same time respecting aspect ratios. Reacts to window resizes and adapts responsively to any screen size.

Here's a bonus (NSFW) working site using jQuery mosaic: https://skinography.net
